### Basic Concept
1. **Player Control:** The player controls a long snake, which moves around the playing area.
2. **Objective:** The primary objective is to eat items (usually depicted as fruits or dots) that appear at random positions. Each time the snake eats an item, it grows longer.
3. **Challenge:** The game becomes more challenging as the snake grows because the player must avoid the snake running into the screen boundaries or into itself.
4. **Game Over:** The game ends when the snake collides with the screen boundary or itself.
