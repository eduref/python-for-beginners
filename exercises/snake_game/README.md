### Basic Concept
1. **Player Control:** The player controls a long snake, which moves around the playing area.
2. **Objective:** The primary objective is to eat items (usually depicted as fruits or dots) that appear at random positions. Each time the snake eats an item, it grows longer.
3. **Challenge:** The game becomes more challenging as the snake grows because the player must avoid the snake running into the screen boundaries or into itself.
4. **Game Over:** The game ends when the snake collides with the screen boundary or itself.



Importing from Packages: Explain how the from snake_game.snake_game import SnakeGame line in play_snake.py imports the SnakeGame class from our snake_game.py file within the snake_game package.
__name__ == "__main__": Clarify that this condition is used to run the code in play_snake.py only when it is executed as the main program, not when it is imported as a module in another file.
File and Folder Names: Make sure the names of files and folders are exactly as specified, as Python is case-sensitive and relies on correct naming for imports.
